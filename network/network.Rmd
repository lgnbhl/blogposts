To begin this year, I was looking for a quick project related to social network visualization. As R analyses on [Game of Thrones](https://shiring.github.io/networks/2017/05/15/got_final), [Star Wars](https://rpubs.com/ogimenez/200849) or [The Lord of The Rings](http://mildlyscientific.schochastics.net/2016/08/10/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-three-networks/) have already been done, I decided to visualize the superhero network of the nowadays very popular Marvel movies saga. In this blog post, we will find out which characters and movies are the most central in the Marvel cinematic universe[^1].

[^1]: those who already know the Marvel movies will not learn anything new, except maybe how to use R for network visualizations.

## Scraping Marvel superheros

As often, the data can be found on Wikipedia. But surprisingly, the data needed was not avaiable in a English article, but within [this](https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liste_des_films_de_l%27univers_cin%C3%A9matographique_Marvel&oldid=144793972#Personnages) French article.

![](input/Screenshot_MarvelWikitable.png)

Let’s scrape this wikitable with the `rvest` package.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
# permanente link for reproductibility
url <- "https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liste_des_films_de_l%27univers_cin%C3%A9matographique_Marvel&oldid=144793972#Personnages"

marvel_df <- url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(".wikitable") %>%
  html_table(fill = TRUE) %>%
  .[[5]]

# write_csv(marvel_df, path = "input/marvel_df.csv")
```

Now that we have the data, we need to clean it as well as translate some
names in English. We also have to distinguish the movie names from the
characters.

```{r}
marvel_df[1,1] <- "Iron Man 1"
marvel_df[2,1] <- "The Incredible Hulk"
marvel_df[4,1] <- "Thor 1"
marvel_df[8,1] <- "Thor: The Dark World"
marvel_df[9,1] <- "Captain America 2"
marvel_df[10,1] <- "Guardians of the Galaxy"
marvel_df[11,1] <- "Avengers: Age of Ultron"
marvel_df[12,1] <- "Ant-Man 1"
marvel_df[14,1] <- "Doctor Strange 1"
marvel_df[15,1] <- "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"
marvel_df[18,1] <- "Black Panther 1"
marvel_df[20,1] <- "Ant-Man and the Wasp"
marvel_df[21,1] <- "Captain Marvel 1"

marvel_df <- marvel_df %>%
  rename("Black Widow" = "Veuve noire",
         "Hawkeye" = "Œil de Faucon",
         "Scarlet Witch" = "Sorcière rouge") %>%
  mutate(Film = factor(Film, levels = unique(Film))) %>%
  mutate_all(funs(str_replace_all(., c("Oui" = "1", "^$" = "0")))) #^$ is for empty string
```

## Reproducing the wikitable with a heatmap

Let’s tidy the data in order to reproduce the Wikipedia table with
`ggplot2`. Note that the characters and movies are in a different order.

```{r chart_MarvelNetwork_1}
marvel_tidy <- marvel_df %>%
  reshape2::melt(id.vars = "Film", value.name = "Value") %>%
  rename("Character" = "variable")

ggplot(marvel_tidy, aes(x = Character, y = Film)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = Value)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("0"="grey", "1"="lightgreen"),
                    name="", labels=c("Out","In")) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        plot.caption = element_text(colour = "dimgrey"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) +
  labs(title = "Characters appearance in the Marvel Movies",
       caption = "Félix Luginbühl (@lgnbhl)\nData source: Wikipedia")
```

## Centrality metrics

In order to know which characters and movies are the most central, we
can use indicators like the degree (number of ties) and the closeness
(centrality based on distance to others in the graph).

```{r}
library(tidygraph)

marvel_graph <- marvel_tidy %>%
  filter(Value != "0") %>%
  select(-Value) %>%
  as_tbl_graph(directed = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree(),
         closeness = centrality_closeness(),
         betweenness = centrality_betweenness()) %>%
  #create type variable
  full_join(tibble(film = marvel_df$Film, type = "Movie"), by = c("name" = "film")) %>%
  mutate(type = replace_na(type, "Character"))

marvel_graph %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>%
  arrange(desc(degree))
```

The central characters are Iron Man and Captain America (*ex aequo*),
followed by Nick Fury, Thor and Hulk. The central movies are the two
Avengers movies and as well as *Captain America: Civil War* (2016).

Who is the most distant character from Iron Man?

```{r}
marvel_graph %>%
  mutate(distance = bfs_dist(name == "Iron Man", mode = "all")) %>%
  filter(type == "Character") %>%
  select(name, distance) %>%
  arrange(desc(distance))
```

Captain Marvel is the most
distant character. However, as the [movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154664/) introducing Captain Marvel will
only be released in 2019, other Marvel characters could be added to the
movie (and therefore reducing the distance from Iron Man).

## Plotting the network

Now let’s visualize the centrality degree of the movies and characters
using {ggraph}.

```{r}
library(ggraph)
set.seed(100)

ggraph(marvel_graph, layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_diagonal(alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_node_point(aes(size = degree, color = as.factor(type)), alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "Type") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), size = 2.5, repel = TRUE) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f8f2e4")) +
  labs(title = "Centrality in the Marvel Cinematic Universe",
       size = "Degree",
       caption = "Félix Luginbühl (@lgnbhl)\n Data source: Wikipedia")
```

Now let’s try some clustering, with the Walktrap algorithm.

```{r chart_MarvelNetwork_3}
set.seed(100)

marvel_graph %>%
  activate(nodes) %>%
  mutate(group_walktrap = group_walktrap()) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "nicely") + 
  geom_edge_diagonal(alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_node_point(aes(color = as.factor(group_walktrap), shape = as.factor(type))) + 
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), size = 2.5, alpha = 0.8, repel = TRUE) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "Walktrap Group") +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f8f2e4")) +
  labs(title = "Clustering the Marvel Cinematic Universe",
       shape = "Type",
       caption = "Félix Luginbühl (@lgnbhl)\n Data source: Wikipedia")
```

The walktrap algorithm is doing a good job, as the characters and the
movies seem correctly grouped.

## An interactive visualization of the Marvel Universe Network

Making an interactive network with {visNetwork} is quite easy. Just play with the interactive network below.

```{r}
library(visNetwork)

dataVis <- marvel_graph %>%
  mutate(group = type) %>%
  toVisNetworkData()

visNetwork(nodes = dataVis$nodes, edges = dataVis$edges, width = "100%",
           main = "Social Network of the Marvel Cinematic Universe") %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed = 100) %>%
  addFontAwesome() %>%
  visGroups(groupname = "Movie", shape = "icon",
            icon = list(code = "f008", color = "darkblue")) %>%
  visGroups(groupname = "Character", shape = "icon",
            icon = list(code = "f007", color = "red")) %>%
  visOptions(highlightNearest = list(enabled = T, hover = T), nodesIdSelection = T) %>%
  visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE)
```
